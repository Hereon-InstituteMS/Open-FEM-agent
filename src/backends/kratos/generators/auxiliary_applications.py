"""Kratos auxiliary applications — utility, infrastructure, and legacy apps.

These do not own their own physics problem types, so they have no
GENERATORS — but the agent needs to know about them because other
generators reference them (e.g. FSI pulls in MappingApplication;
parallel runs need TrilinosApplication + MetisApplication; HDF5
output needs HDF5Application).

Source: upstream Kratos `applications/` directory listing.  Every name
in `KNOWLEDGE` below must correspond to a real sub-application.
