"""
Per-physics layer-3 sweep across every available backend.

Drives each backend through its `generate_input` + `run` path with the same
canonical reference problem per physics row, captures pass/fail, elapsed
wall-clock, and a key scalar (max(u), tip displacement, ...) from the VTU
output.  Emits a markdown table at the end and a JSON dump for downstream
plotting.

Env vars required for the full sweep (set automatically if matching install
exists on disk):
    DEAL_II_DIR     deal.II cmake config dir (.../lib/cmake/deal.II)
    FOURC_BINARY    Path to the built 4C binary
    FOURC_ROOT      Source root for FOURC (some templates depend on it)

Run:
    python benchmarks/sweep_layer3.py [--only POISSON]

`--only` accepts a comma-separated list of row names that exist in
`MATRIX` below.  Additional physics rows are added in follow-up PRs;
keep this docstring in sync with the actual matrix.

#                     both solve a Dirichlet hot/cold-wall problem
#                     (T=0 on one side, T=100 on the other, no source)
#                     so max(T) = 100 by boundary data, *not* the
#                     source-driven 0.0737 from POISSON.  Variant
#                     names are not shared across backends (FEniCSx
#                     and deal.II use `2d_steady`; skfem / NGSolve /
#                     Kratos / 4C use a plain `2d`); the cell entries
#                     below pick the right variant per backend.  As
#                     with POISSON, the comparison scalar is max(T)
#                     of whichever scalar field the template emits
#                     (the field name itself is per-backend: FEniCSx
#                     `temperature`, 4C `phi_1`, ...).
#
#   ELASTICITY        Each backend's `linear_elasticity/2d` (or
#                     equivalent) template on the rectangular domain
#                     it ships with.  Material: E=1000, ν=0.3.  The
#                     2D plane-strain-vs-plane-stress choice is a
#                     per-template detail and is not enforced here —
#                     the agent has to read each generator to see
#                     which it uses (FEniCSx and skfem both compute
#                     λ = E·ν / ((1+ν)·(1-2ν)), i.e. the standard
#                     plane-strain / 3D form, so for those two the
#                     numbers are directly comparable; other backends
#                     have not been audited here).  As a consequence,
#                     the cross-backend numbers are NOT guaranteed to
#                     agree as absolute values across all six cells.  Comparison metric per cell depends on
#                     the field type:
#                       - vector-valued displacement output (NGSolve,
#                         FEniCSx, 4C, Kratos): the scalar reported is
#                         the maximum L2 magnitude of the displacement
#                         across nodes — `core.post_processing.post_process_file`
#                         collapses multi-component point arrays via
#                         `np.linalg.norm(arr, axis=1)` before
#                         min/max/mean/std.
#                       - per-component fields (deal.II writes "ux",
#                         "uy" separately): the cell asks for one
#                         component (typically the dominant one) so
#                         the scalar there is the maximum of that
#                         component, not a magnitude.
#                     Standardising the elasticity templates so a
#                     single closed-form reference is usable across all
#                     backends is a follow-up.
#
# More rows (heat, stokes, …) are added in follow-up PRs.

    #           `.vtu` entry above.
    #
    #   .pvd    excluded — `pv.read("*.pvd")` returns a `MultiBlock`,
    #           not a flat `DataSet`.  `post_process_file()` assumes
    #           the flat shape, so accepting `.pvd` here would turn
    #           every cell that writes a `.pvd` index into a
    #           `postproc_failed` even when a perfectly good `.vtu`
    #           partial sits next to it.  Re-enabling `.pvd` is
    #           blocked on `core/post_processing.py` learning to
    #           pick a block / time-step from a MultiBlock.

    # for what is actually accepted.  This comment block describes
    # *why* — never re-add a suffix here without verifying that
    # `post_process_file` can read it as a flat DataSet.
    #
    # Suffix matching is case-insensitive: some backends and
    # filesystems emit upper-case (`.VTU`) and `read_mesh` itself
    # lower-cases the suffix before dispatching.
    #
    # Sort numerically by trailing step index, NOT lexicographically:
    # backends like Kratos emit `Structure_0_1.vtk, Structure_0_2.vtk,
    # ..., Structure_0_10.vtk`, where lexicographic sort would place
    # `_10` *before* `_9` and pick the wrong snapshot as "the last".
    # Within the same step, prefer the most-PyVista-stable format
    # (`.vtu` > `.vtk` > `.xdmf`) so two formats emitted for the
    # same step never pick a less-supported container.

    # collection into a `MultiBlock`, not a single `DataSet`, and

    # post-processing learning to pick a block / time-step from a
    # MultiBlock collection (a separate piece of work in
